# Linc Language Support Extension

This is the offical VSCode extension for Linc, that provides basic "token-based" syntax-highlighting as well as auto "bracket-pair" insertion, required to be able to effectively program in the language. More to come soon.

Also take a look at [the main project repository](https://github.com/fosspointer/linc).
